#were doing hex plot shit to show a quasi network map to different hurricane resources
#then were gonna overlay that with poverty as a vertical so we can highlight low income, low resource areas
#this will identify areas that need more resources, obvi
#2nd set of maps can just show spatial need for specific types of resources, like supermarkets or hardware stores
#we can then focus on the areas highlighted by our initial map to see which of the various resources are missing there
#i.e. show a 'needs supermarket' or 'needs firestation' map and then we can be like wow we should put a firestation here to make thigns suck less
